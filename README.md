### Installation

```bash
cd birthday_candle_blower
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV 4.8.0+
- NumPy 1.24.0+
- Pygame 2.5.0+
- Webcam (HD resolution recommended)

### Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

**Controls**:

- **R**: Restart game (stops music and resets)
- **A**: Toggle ASCII filter ON/OFF
- **Q**: Quit

**Gameplay Tips**:
- Press **A** to toggle ASCII filter for clearer camera view
- Watch progress bar at bottom to see blow detection progress
- Avoid wide smiles - only pout gestures are detected
- Hold pout gesture steady for 1-2 seconds

## Technical Highlights

### Chiptune Converter
- **8-bit Processing**: 6-bit quantization (64 levels) for robotic crunch
- **Hybrid Waveform**: 45% pulse wave, 20% triangle, 35% original signal
- **Modulation Effects**: 6.5 Hz vibrato, 6 Hz PWM for mechanical character
- **Visualization**: 12 pattern types (spirals, stars, flowers, mandalas) triggered by pitch/beat detection
- **Smart Pattern System**: High pitch (>3000 Hz) and pitch jumps (>800 Hz) trigger complex patterns

### Birthday Candle Blower
- **Face Detection**: Haar Cascade classifiers with mouth characteristic analysis
- **Pout Detection Algorithm**: 
  - Mouth area <6% of face area
  - Circular aspect ratio (0.35-1.0)
  - Width <40% of face width
  - Lower face position verification
- **ASCII Filter**: Converts camera to ASCII characters (` .:-=+*#%@`) while maintaining detection
- **Victory Animation**: 8 cats distributed in 2Ã—4 grid, bouncing with sine wave motion
- **HD Resolution**: 1280Ã—720 camera with 400px wide cake design

- Dominant square wave (45%) for "beep-boop" quality
- Fast vibrato and PWM for robotic warble
- Limited frequency: 120 Hz - 6 kHz
- Aggressive compression and subtle echo

**Sample Rate Impact**:
- **11025 Hz**: Ultra lo-fi Game Boy DMG sound
- **22050 Hz**: Classic NES/arcade quality
- **44100 Hz**: Clear but mechanical SNES/PS1 style

- **RAM**: 8GB+ for optimal performance
- **Camera**: HD webcam recommended for birthday game
- **OS**: macOS, Linux, Windows supported

### Known Issues
- **Python 3.12+**: May have compatibility issues with `librosa` and `numba` dependencies in Chiptune Converter
- macOS: Exit code 139 (segmentation fault) may occur on close - doesn't affect functionality
- Large audio files (>10MB) take longer to process
- Voice quality depends on microphone hardware

## Tips for Best Results

### Chiptune Converter
- Use clear melodies for better visualization patterns
- Lower sample rates emphasize retro character
- Speak clearly for voice recording, not too close to mic
- Instrumental tracks show pattern transitions more clearly

### Birthday Candle Blower
- Ensure good lighting for face detection
- Purse lips in small circular shape (not wide smile)
- Use ASCII filter toggle (A key) if camera view too blurry
- Add `happybirthdaysong.mp3` to project folder for victory music
- Position face directly toward camera at arm's length
